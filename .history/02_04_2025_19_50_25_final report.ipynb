    "\n",
    "A research group at UBC is hosting a Minecraft server and collecting data about the players and their play sessions to learn more about how people play video games. In their study, they formed two datasets, one with personal information about each participant and another with information on each individual session played. As part of the project they also created a newsletter that players could subscribe to for game-related information. Our group will be working with the dataset containing information about the players to answer a predictive question relating to the newsletter subscription status.\n",
