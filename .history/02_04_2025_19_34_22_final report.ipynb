Each player is uniquely identified by `hashedEmail` (character type), an anonymized string to protect privacy. Gameplay engagement is measured through `played_hours` (double type), ranging from 0 to 223.1 hours, with an average of 5.8 hours. Player names (`name`, character type) may include duplicates despite unique hashed emails. The `gender` variable (character type) lists seven self-reported categories. `Age` (double type) ranges from 8 to 50 years, with a median of 17 and mean of 20.5, reflecting a predominantly teenage user base."
